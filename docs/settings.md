The **Settings** page allows you to manage your plan, control default filters for your Discounts list, and set the display priority for different discount types on your storefront.

## 📄 Current Plan

Clicking it takes you to the **Pricing** page, where you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel.

## 🏷 Published Discounts

<span style="color:#d32f2f;"><strong>Note:</strong></span> These filters will be pre-applied every time you visit the Discounts page.

## 🎯 Discount Priority Order

Here you determine **which discount type and priority level** should be applied first on the storefront.

Two main discount types are supported:
1. **Percentage Discount**
2. **Fixed Price Discount**

Each type has two **priority levels**:
- **Higher First** — Displays the highest discount value first.
- **Lower First** — Displays the lowest discount value first.

You can reorder the **types** themselves and the **priority levels within each type** using the ▲ (up) and ▼ (down) buttons.

---

### Saving Your Priority Order
Once you’ve arranged the priority exactly how you want:
- Click **Save Priority Order** at the bottom.
- The new order will be applied globally to all widgets on your storefront.

!!! note "Tip"
    Use **Higher First** for more aggressive discount marketing (best offer up front).  
    Use **Lower First** for campaigns where you want smaller discounts to be more visible.
