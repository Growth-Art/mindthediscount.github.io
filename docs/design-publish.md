# Design & Publish Discount Widget

The **Design & Publish** page allows you to fully customize the look and feel of your discount widget before publishing it live to your store. You can modify every visual and textual element, preview the design instantly, and apply your changes to the storefront.

---

## 1. Live Preview
At the top of the page, you’ll see a **live preview** of how your discount widget will appear on the product page. This preview updates in real-time as you adjust styles, texts, or colors.

---

## 2. Editable Text Fields
You can change all the text that appears in the widget:

- **Discount Message** – The main promotional text (e.g., *Today Only Extra 15% OFF*).
- **Bottom Text Message** – Additional instructions or disclaimers (e.g., *Just use code SUMMER at checkout*).
- **Discount Code** – The code displayed inside the widget.
- **Price Text** – The price label shown in the discount box.

---

## 3. Font Customization
Each text element allows you to customize:

- **Font Size** – Enter the desired size in pixels.
- **Font Family** – Choose from available font options.
- **Font Weight** – Select text thickness (e.g., *Regular (400)* or *Bold (700)*).

---

## 4. Color Controls
You can change colors for:

- **Text Color** – Adjust the main discount message color.
- **Bottom Text Color** – Set a separate color for the bottom message.
- **Background Color** – Define the background fill of the discount widget.
- **Border Color** – Customize the border outline color.

A built-in color picker makes it easy to select any tone.

---

## 5. Icons and Borders
- **Discount Icon** – Pick from a selection of icons (e.g., Sale, Fire, Tag) to display alongside the message.
- **Border Style** – Choose between styles like *Dashed* or *Solid*.
- **Border Radius** – Set rounded corners (in pixels) for a softer look.

---

## 6. Additional Options
- **Show Price in Discount Box** – Toggle this option if you want the discounted price to appear directly inside the widget.

---

## 7. Saving and Publishing
Once you finish designing:

1. **Update** – Saves your changes and applies them to the widget.
2. **Cancel** – Discards your current edits.
3. After saving, your design will be **published** to your storefront and visible to customers based on the visibility settings defined in the **Discount Detail** page.

**Tip:** You can return to this page anytime to refresh your design, change seasonal themes, or adjust branding colors.
