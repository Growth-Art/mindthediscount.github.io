# Adding the Discount Widget to Your Online Store

To make your discount widget visible on your storefront, you need to add it as a block in your store's live theme. Follow these steps:

---

## 1. Access the Theme Editor
1. In your Shopify admin panel, go to **Online Store → Themes**.
2. Find your **live theme** and click **Customize**.

---

## 2. Open the Desired Product Template
1. In the theme editor’s top bar, use the **page selector** to navigate to a **product page** where you want the discount widget to appear.
2. This ensures you are editing the correct **Product Template**.

---

## 3. Add the Widget as a Block
1. In the **left sidebar** of the theme editor, locate the **main section** for your product page (e.g., *Product Information*, *Product Details*).
2. Click on that section to open its settings.
3. Scroll to the **Blocks** area and click **Add block**.
4. From the list, choose **App → [Your Discount Widget App Name]**.

---

## 4. Position the Widget
1. Drag and drop the widget block to the position you want (e.g., below the product title, above the “Add to Cart” button).
2. This position will determine where customers see the discount information.

---

## 5. Visibility Settings
The widget’s visibility on the storefront will follow the settings you configured in the **Discount Detail** page:
- **Visible for all products**
- **Visible for selected products**
- **Visible for selected collections**
- **Hidden** (won’t display on the storefront)

---

## 6. Save and Publish
1. Click **Save** in the theme editor to apply the changes.
2. View your product page on the storefront to confirm the widget appears in the right place.

---

**Tip:** You can repeat this process for other product templates if you want the widget to appear in multiple layouts.
